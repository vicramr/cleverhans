    Parameters present in projected_gradient_descent are the same as in that function.
    :param model_fn: a callable that takes an input tensor and returns the model logits.
    :param x: input tensor.
    :param eps: epsilon (input variation parameter); see https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572.
    :param eps_iter: step size for each attack iteration
    :param nb_iter: Number of attack iterations.
    :param norm: Order of the norm (mimics NumPy). Possible values: np.inf, 1 or 2.
    :param clip_min: (optional) float. Minimum float value for adversarial example components.
    :param clip_max: (optional) float. Maximum float value for adversarial example components.
    :param y: (optional) Tensor with true labels. If targeted is true, then provide the
              target label. Otherwise, only provide this parameter if you'd like to use true
              labels when crafting adversarial samples. Otherwise, model predictions are used
              as labels to avoid the "label leaking" effect (explained in this paper:
              https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01236). Default is None.
    :param targeted: (optional) bool. Is the attack targeted or untargeted?
              Untargeted, the default, will try to make the label incorrect.
              Targeted will instead try to move in the direction of being more like y.
    :param rand_init: (optional) bool. Whether to start the attack from a randomly perturbed x.
    :param rand_minmax: (optional) bool. Support of the continuous uniform distribution from
              which the random perturbation on x was drawn. Effective only when rand_init is
              True. Default equals to eps.
    :param sanity_checks: bool, if True, include asserts (Turn them off to use less runtime /
              memory or for unit tests that intentionally pass strange input)
    :param l1_penalty: float. The coefficient for the L1 penalty term.
    :return: a tensor for the adversarial example
